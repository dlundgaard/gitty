# Gitty

Command line interface for enhanced workflow when using the Git CLI. 

## How To Use
You run `gitty` simply by calling `gitty` from the command line, no arguments, no bells and whistles. This will prompt you as to which `git` command you would like execute. 

## Install 
You can install `gitty` from `crates.io` using
```
cargo install gitty
```
Alternatively, you can build locally with `rust` by cloning this repo and using `cargo run` from within the `gitty` directory
